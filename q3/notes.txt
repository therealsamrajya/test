chain bhhaneko chai seq of number where each number is exactly greater by 1 than its previous value the sequence can occur in any  numbeer

inputed array lai set ma convert garni to decrease the time complexity allows us to easily check if a number exists in the array without having to scan through the entire array each time.

has checks ki tyo item array ma xa ki xaina

(num-1) ley check garxa if it is the start of array 

if it is true it  sets the number as the currrent number  and chain as 1 
ani feri check garni while loop use garera testai arko number xa ki nai bhanera 
cha bhaney  increase the counter by 1 and  currentNum is incremented 
continue the loop jabasamma seq ma airakaxa

eg: [100,1,2,3]
suru ma num ko value 100 
num.set(100-1)= 99 not in array 
so it is the starting of sequence
chain is 1 as there is no 101 
 
iterate to 2nd num
num.set(1-1)=0
no 0 , so 1 is starting of seq
while ley check gardai janxa ani puaxa 2,3, sab xa ani math.max ley initalize garxa  


time complexity = 
o(n) for converting n array to n sets
main loop iterates through every element once that is o(n)
For each number, we might potentially check all consecutive numbers, but across all iterations, we will at most check each number once.
